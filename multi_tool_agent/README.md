- **Location**: `core/orchestrator.py`

### Module 2: Course Advisor Agent  
- **Technology**: Python, integration with Course Catalog DB
- **Purpose**: Intelligent course recommendations with prerequisite checking and constraint-based filtering
- **Location**: `agents/course_advisor.py`

### Module 3: Library Agent
- **Technology**: Python, NLP libraries, Library Management System API integration
- **Purpose**: 24/7 virtual librarian for catalog search, availability checking, and location services
- **Location**: `tools/library_tools.py`, `agents/library_agent.py`

### Module 4: Events Agent
- **Technology**: Python, University Calendar/Events DB integration  
- **Purpose**: Event discovery, personalized notifications, and registration assistance
- **Location**: `tools/event_tools.py`, `agents/events_agent.py`

### Module 5: User Profile & Personalization Module
- **Technology**: Python, PostgreSQL/MongoDB database
- **Purpose**: User data storage and personalization engine with privacy management
- **Location**: `core/user_profile.py`

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Google API Key for Gemini models

### Installation

1. **Clone/download the project**
```bash
cd multi_tool_agent
```

2. **Install dependencies**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. **Set up environment variables**
Create a `.env` file with:
```

```

4. **Run the demo**
```bash
python demo.py
```

## üí° Usage Examples

### Course Planning
```
"Which AI electives can I take next semester that don't have morning classes?"
```

### Library Services  
```
"Do you have 'Clean Code' by Robert Martin and where can I find it?"
```

### Event Discovery
```
"What programming workshops are happening this month?"
```

### Personalized Recommendations
```
"Show me my profile and give me personalized recommendations"
```

### Multi-domain Queries
```
"Find me a book about machine learning and tell me about AI events"
```
